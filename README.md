# CUDA-Learning-Journal

Embarking on the journey of CUDA learning is both intriguing and extensive. To record my progress and insights, I will maintain a journal within this repository. My goal is to execute all the code snippets within the collaborative environment of Google Colab, ensuring accessibility and ease of experimentation.

## step
1. shared memory
2. no bank conflict
3. multiple elements in one thread
4. vectorized memory access

## Streaming MultiProcessor
1. SM have shared memory, register file , warp sechduler ans so on.
2. One block can only be in one SM, but one SM contain multiple blocks.
